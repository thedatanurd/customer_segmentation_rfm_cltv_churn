        "Business Logic": "If `IsChurned = TRUE`, the customer is tagged as churned. This typically means they haven\u2019t returned after the full churn risk period (90+ days).",
        "Business Interpretation": "This group is considered inactive and unlikely to return without a very strong win-back strategy.",
        "Recommended Actions": "Send one last reactivation campaign or exit survey. Avoid high-budget targeting.",
        "Marketing Strategy": "Use a final win-back discount or feedback request to understand churn reasons.",

        "Example Customer Traits": "No orders in 90+ days and previously flagged inactive.",
